# DTT 2 IP

Broadcast to IP conversion for Wifi indoor coverage

The goal of the this project is to have a full working solution in order to provide terrestrial television, for any indoor Wi-Fi network, that can be access on any portable device. In order to achieve this we have set a few requirements in order to have a standardized solution that can fulfill any demand from the user perspective. 
These are the following: 
* 2 or more DVB-T tuners 
* Good image quality and response 
* Interoperability with all devices (Android, iOS, etc.) 
* Does not block your Wi-Fi for TV only 
* Plug and play and easy to use 
* Multiple user capabilities for watching different programs 
* Interoperability with other SAT>IP servers 
* EPG / Subtitles / HbbTV 
* Wireless connectivity to our network 
* Build-in storage / usb ports / network storage 
* Recording capabilities 
* Be accessible from any device that haves a browser
