###### Conclusions
We have manage to create, based on the Sat>IP standard, our own server for converting DVB-T RF signal to IP packets and stream it through an indoor Wi-Fi network. Being only a software implementation, and using common and well-used development environment, we have deployed it easily on different hardware platforms. Another feature that we have accomplished is the universality for the client application, which means that every user can have a freedom of choice for displaying the broadcast channels.
