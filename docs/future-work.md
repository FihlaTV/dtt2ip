# Future work

From the server perspective they may exist improvements all the time, as well as maintaining the code up to date with the new client software requirements. The server must have a configuration page where you can request new scans, configure some parameter, however it must be keeps as simple as possible. This page must provide some real-time and relevant information regarding the status of the server.
The second possible future work must be in the direction of creating our own client software that will run on the entire mobile device, this including Windows 10 phones and tables (by doing this desktops can also have this application as well). This client must provide all the features carried on the transport stream (subtitles, Teletext, HbbTv). Another future implementation can be to provide connectivity to the server through a browser, by using and leveraging MPEG-DASH. As proof of concept we have a basic demo in the “demoTestLiveTools.tar.gz” package. Unpack the compressed file, and run as root the “demoTestLiveTools.py” script. This will install the necessary tools that will be used and create and “index.html” page, that can be access directly from your host. This will display a basic video player, which will start playing off the air the broadcast channel.
