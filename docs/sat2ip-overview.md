#Sat>IP overview

SAT>IP is a protocol standardized by ETSI, and was developed by SES S.A, British Sky Broadcasting Ltd and Craftwork ApS on the 8th of January 2015, and the version we have used is 1.2.2. In this chapter will cover the importance of this standard in our project, together with a small description.
In order to have a standardized communication protocol between clients and server, we have chose SAT>IP protocol, which provided satellite broadcasting to IP through the local Wi-Fi networks. This gives the advantage of leveraging preexisting client applications, and completes the offer of live broadcasting  (DVB-S and DVB-T).

SAT>IP specifies a communication protocol. SAT>IP is not a device specification. The SAT>IP protocol may be applied in different devices. Industry is left to come up with new and innovative devices using the SAT>IP protocol. 
The SAT>IP protocol distinguishes between SAT>IP clients and SAT>IP servers. Actual devices may be clients or servers or both depending on their feature set.
